🍰Birthday's project🍰

🔸Project is simulated event last year in Facebook's Timeline.<br>
🔸I created this project for celebration with my friend in 24 years old.<br>
🔸I builded this project within 24 hours since 02/05/2022 10:30 GMT+7.<br>
🔸Original idea is "How to summary one year in one page" then I choosed timeline style for present this way of project.'<br>
🔸Then, you can't come to main project when time didn't reach 02/11/2022 00:00 GMT+7.<br>
🔸It's will toggle condition to go timeline site and when time reached you can't go back to previous site.<br>
🔸I know waiting is boring that why I made mini fortune taller with 'Tarot-Card' in major mrcana. (Card number 0-21)<br>
